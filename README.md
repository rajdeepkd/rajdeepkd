 Hi, I'm Rajdeep Kr. Dutta ( @rajdeepkd ), currently persuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science Engineering branch from Gauhati University Instiute of Science and Technology.
 I am facinated about Computer Science in general and its wide range of applications to solve real life problems. I constantly try to seek knowledge and expand my horizon in thhis field.
 I'm learning front end and back end part of Web Development and Machine Learning using Python Programming Language.
 I believe that collaborations and working on projects which will benefit the society is the way we can take this field forward into a much bigger sector than it already is.
